Citibank did not learn from the LTA fiasco about the EZlink card issue. Citibank should at least sent notification to all the account holders in a push mail via SMS to warn well beforehand that the new upgrade of the APP requires the Handphone OS to be at least Andriod \"X\" but not only when one wants to use it. Sigh!!!",

There is a Global Wallet but it is unable to process a basic payee set-up even though there is nothing wrong with the receiving account's information. The app just keeps saying the information is invalid. Question: why bother providing IT banking functions when they don't work? I suspect the IT team never ever tests out the app or online banking functions themselves before launching the service. Customers beware.",

There are clearly dependencies that should be skipped, like checking for location (2) No error returned if the OTP pin is incorrect. This will lead to account inactivation (3) Fingerprint often fails requiring entering pwd (4) Unable to paste from clipboard. Annoying when entering account numbers, or other details. Should allow paste in every entry fields used. Fix these 4 issues, for 5 star",

App interface and Citibank site help content do not match. I have been searching for a tab that does not exist on the App. For God's sake, have a proper CI/CD pipeline for documentation/help-content. If your team is not technically competent, then do version management for documentation at least. 4. I still can't figure how to do cashback on this App!

I am extremely grateful for the Bank's help for me to own my first HUDC apartment at Braddell Hill in 1986. Naturally, I treasure my Citi Visa Card dearly to remind me of the chinese virtue \"飲水思源\" untill today. Having said that, I am also behave like some common typical Singaporean who always try to ask for waiver of annual membership fee of $150 for using the Visa Card. The request for waiver can only be done through phone. I only realized recently after pressing for so many keys that the vital \"Waiver of Fee\" option was missing. I am pondering whether it is about time to give up the card or continue to incur the charges for some sentimental reasons to keep the card. Hopefully the Bank is kind enough to solve this dilemma for me. Thanks.",
